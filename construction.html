    <p>Marcus has chosen the life of a Construction worker. It may not be his dream job but at least the pay is good and he can almost work anytime and anywhere a handyman is needed. But who's to say that something bad can't happen to him on the job if he isn't careful? Does he learn to enjoy the work and with that bettering himself? Or does he become careless and ends up injuring himself?
